        <h2>This Example Illustrates background-image property.
        </h2>
        <p>
            This image is horizontally centered (because it should
            be 50 percent of the screenâ€™s width from the left side of
            the page) and one-fifth of the way down from the top
            of the screen (because it is positioned 20 percent of the
            window height from the top of the screen). It is worth
            trying this example in the code download ( ch08_eg08
            .html ) and changing the size of the browser window to
            see how the background image remains in the center of
            the browser window horizontally and one-fifth of the
            way down the window vertically when you change
            the size of the window.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you specify a background image, you can use the background-attachment property (values
            shown in Table 8-5) to specify whether the image is fixed in its position, or whether it moves as the
            user scrolls up and down the page.
