       <h1>Thinking Inside the Box</h1> 
       <p class="description">When you are styling a web page with CSS you must start to think in terms of <b>boxes</b>.</p>
       <p>Each element is treated as if it generates a new box. Each box can have new rules associated with it.</p>
       <img src="leapYear.jpg" alt="How CSS treats a box" width="100" height="100">
       <p>As you can see from the diagram above, each box has a <b>border</b>. Between the content and the border you can have 
          <b>padding</b>, and outside of the border you can have a <b>margin</b> to separate this box from any neighboring boxes.
