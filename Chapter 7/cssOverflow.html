                    out of the box. (You learn how to deal with this in the next section).As you just saw in Figure 7-34, when you control the size of a box, the content you want to 
                    fit in the box might require more space than you have allowed for it. This happens not only with the min-height and max-height or min-width and max-width properties
                    but also for a number of other reasons. The overflow property was designed to deal with these situations and can take one of the values shown Table 7-16.
